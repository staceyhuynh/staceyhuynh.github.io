        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <p>
<br>I'm in Key Club and the Lq Girls Volleyball frosh team. I was involved </br>
<br>in a lot of sports activities which includes basketball, softball, </br>
<br>football, volleyball, and other sports that I'm not too involved with.</br>
<br>I didn't do much voulenteer work since I'm still a freshman not including</br> 
<br>helping teachers before and after school.</br>
            </p>
        <p>
<br>Some awards that I had throughout middle school were three art awards.</br>
<br>My art work was put on display in a mall and on Main Street in Garden </br>
<br>Grove. There were five PE awards as well which is for the score of the</br> 
<br>fitness test, one wasbecause I was nominated for best sportsmanship. I </br>
<br>also recieved a couple destinguished honor roll awards which are based </br>
<br>on GPA.</br> 
            </p>   
        <p>
<br>At the momment, I'm thinking about going into animation or something in</br>
<br>the general area. Although right now I'm going into the computer pathway,</br>
<br>I would perfer to take film and computer graphics. I've taken four</br> 
<br>computer classes:computer essentials 1, computer essentials 2, explore</br> 
<br>computer science, and explore computer science principals AP. The other</br>
<br>class I took was outside of computers which was intro to art.</br>
